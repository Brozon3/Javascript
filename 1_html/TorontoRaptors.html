                <p> Hey everyone, my name is Pat and I'm the author of this page. I am curently enrolled in a Software Development program and I made this page for an
                     assignment in my Javascript class. I've been watching basketball since the early 2000's and have spent countless hours watching NBA games, reading
                     NBA articles and listening to NBA podcasts. As a result I consider myself very knowledgeable about the NBA and will post my own thoughts and
                     opinions here on this page with quotes from my favorite writers from time to time. As my fiancee says: <q>You know way to much about basketball</q>. 
                     This page will contain information about the Toronto Raptors and I will update it regularly, but if you want to stay up to date on all news
                     related to the Raptors please visit <a href="https://www.nba.com/raptors">the official website of the Toronto Raptors.</a></p>

                <h3><i>Summary</i></h3>
                <p>The Toronto Raptors are a Canadian professional basketball team based in Toronto. The Raptors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) 
                    as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Atlantic Division. They play their home games at Scotiabank Arena, which they share with the 
                    Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team was founded in 1995 as part of the NBA's expansion into Canada, along with the 
                    Vancouver Grizzlies. Since the 2001-02 season, the Raptors have been the only Canadian-based team in the league, as the Grizzlies relocated from 
                    Vancouver to Memphis, Tennessee.</p>

                <h2 id="CurrentSeason">Current Season</h2>
                <p>The Raptors currently have a win-loss record of 21-27 which means that the Raptors are falling short of their expectations this season. Before the 
                    season started a lot of NBA writers and NBA experts expected the Raptors to be a top team in the Eastern Conference. Now, NBA experts are saying 
                    things like this:</p>
                <blockquote id="quote">
                    <p>"I was dramatically wrong about the Toronto Raptors. I thought the Raptors were gonna be good. Whatever their over/under was—I can't remember 
                        what it was—I was like over, over, over. Um, they're 16-22. Every possession is a slog, and they're starting a home stand now that is gonna 
                        make or break their season. And they started it with an almost-miraculous-comeback-win-but-loss to Milwaukee last night in another game where 
                        their offense was horrible.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Their defense hasn't been as good as I expected it to be. And you're starting to feel the downsides of the kind of style that they've chosen 
                        of just all length, all size, all versatility. Well, you know, guards are good, shooting is good, and they don't have enough of those things. 
                        Centers are good. Those downsides have come to roost."</p>
                    <cite>- Zach Lowe</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Not everything is bad for the Raptors though. Pascal Siakam is having an all-star caliber season and has shown that he can be the best player on a 
                    very good NBA team. Plus, OG Anunoby is showing that he is one of the best defenders in the entire league and Scottie Barnes is starting to warm 
                    up after a very slow start. Overall I think the Raptors will look to move some pieces before the trade deadline, and if you want to stay up to 
                    date with news and trades, this webpage will be the perfect place because I'll be updating this page throughout the season.</p>

                <h2 id="GROAT">Greatest Raptor of All Time List (GROAT)</h2>
                <p>Raptors fans always debate who is the best player in team history, also known as the Greatest Raptor of All Time (GROAT). Below is my personal GROAT 
                    rankings with some career statistics and brief explainations to give some insight into who these players are and why I have them ranked the way I do:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>1. Kyle Lowry</b></li>
                        <p>Seasons Played with Raptors: 9 - <b>Championships with Raptors: 1</b> - All Star Selections: 6</p>
                        <p>Kyle Lowry's tenure with the Raptors coincided with the best stretch in Raptors history. He arrived part-way through the 2013-2014 season at 
                            which point the Raptors weren't considered a very good team. Starting the 2014-2015, his first full season as a Raptor, the Raptors would start 
                            the most successful stretch is team history, winning their division multiple times and capping that stretch by winning a championship during the 
                            2018-2019 season. Even though Kyle isn't considered the most skilled player on this list, his importance to the team and fanbase cannot be put 
                            into words.</p>
                    <li><b>2. Kawhi Leonard</b></li>
                        <p>Seasons Played with Raptors: 1 - <b>Championships with Raptors: 1</b> - Finals MVP: 2 - <b>Defensive Player of the Year: 2</b> - All Star Selections: 5</p>
                        <p>Kawhi Leonard is arguably the most talented player to ever wear a Raptors jersey. He was traded to the Raptors before the 2018-2019 season and
                            only stayed for one season before signing with the LA Clippers. He made use of his time in Toronto though, winning the one and only title in team
                            history while being the best player on the team and winning Finals MVP in the process.</p>
                    <li><b>3. Vince Carter</b></li>
                        <p>Seasons Played with Raptors: 7 - <b>Rookie of the Year: 1</b> - All Star Selections: 8</p>
                        <p>Vince Carter is a historical player for the Toronto Raptors. The team was added to the NBA the same year as the Vancouver Grizzlies and some 
                            people say that the only reason the Raptors stuck around and the Grizzlies didn't was because of the impact that Vince, nicknamed Air Canada, had 
                            on the team, the city and even the country. Even though his tenure with the Raptors ended on bad terms, his impact was noticable and he alone is 
                            partially responsible for the boom in basketball talent coming out of Canada over the past 10 years</p>
                    <li><b>4. DeMar DeRozan</b></li>
                        <p>Seasons Played with Raptors: 9 - <b>All Star Selections: 5</b></p>
                        <p>DeMar was drafted by the Raptors before the 2009-2010 season. In the first few years he showed improvement and impressed fans with his athletitcism 
                            and smooth game in the midrange, but never saw success until the Kyle Lowry trade happened. Kyle and Demar became close friends and had an impact on 
                            each other, but also on the culture surrounding the Raptors. Unfortunate for DeMar, he fell short in the playoffs time and time again, leading up to 
                            the Kawhi trade and took most of the blame as to why the Raptors continued to fall short in the playoffs.</p>
                    <li><b>5. Chris Bosh</b></li>
                        <p>Seasons Played with Raptors: 7 - <b>All Star Selections: 11</b></p>
                        <p>Bosh was drafted by the Raptors 4<sup>th</sup> overall before the 2003-2004 season and in the same draft as LeBron James. Bosh's tenure with the Raptors 
                            was unsuccessful in terms of team success, but that was more due to mismanagement of the roster and a lack of talent surrounding Bosh. Bosh as an 
                            individual was spectacular and it shows in his career numbers and the success he would see after he left Toronto to join LeBron James and Dwane Wade 
                            in Miami, which kickstarted an era of the NBA called "The Big 3" era.</p>
